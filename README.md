Experimenting with scikit-learn

This is a collection of scripts created while attempting to learn about data science using scikit-learn. It explores some of the fundamental models and techniques for the field. It contains comments and explanations of all code used to deepen the reader's understanding of the model's purpose and use case. The goal of this repository is to share example implementations of sklearn complete with explanations of relevant data science principles. Adaptation and experimentation are encouraged!

## Requirements
* Python 3
* scikit-learn
  * Requires NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib
